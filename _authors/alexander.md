I manage the Bird Calls website and I'm tall. Because I'm tall, people always ask me: do you play basketball? I do not. I think my height impairs my mathematical skills. When I don't duck, I hit my head a lot on door frames, ceilings, etc.. I estimate ~2 times per month I hit my head so hard I must lie down. I am worried that my reasoning capabilities have degenerated over time.
