Olivia is usually a late bird who would indeed not get the worm but she'd stick around to see what happens afterward. She is recently emboldened by a stretch of illness to assert her edges and to strut boldly into the subdued streets of Viennese nights and days. She has not been that sick for some years, and she feels she is likely to die one day of a respiratory illness such as pneumonia. Lately she is interested in accidentally, but eventually on purpose, writing fiction.
