In every change, I would thoroughly bathe.  
Tree, may your shadow's gradation  
rinse me, so I may cleanly crave  
  
this sun, with its boundary brave,  
spilling upon me such fine abrasion.  
In every change, I would thoroughly bathe,  
  
rubbing like a bear upon his cave,  
shedding dreamless nights' accretion.  
–Rinse me, so I may cleanly crave  
  
this wind, to work the cloth I've yet saved  
from the staining paradox of self-ablation.  
In every change, I would thoroughly bathe,  
  
relinquishing the preparation of my grave.  
It lies outside the boundary of my creation.  
–Rinse me, so I may cleanly crave  
  
to continue lying here, in your nave,  
welcoming the will and temptation  
in every change: I would thoroughly bathe.  
Rinse me, so I may cleanly crave.
