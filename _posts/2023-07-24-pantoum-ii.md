We never went to the sea,  
  
but we dreamed of it;  
  
that was enough   
  
for you and me.  
  
We dreamed at  
  
the aching seashore,  
  
you and me,  
  
of the poems we would write,  
  
to soothe our aching pleas.  
  
The saltwater encased my eyes  
  
in the poems we wrote  
  
and never exchanged.  
  
The crystalline sea  
  
we neither visited nor traversed  
  
was enough  
  
for those such as we.
