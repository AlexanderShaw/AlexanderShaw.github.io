I won't call you home  
  
because near  

you will remain  
  
far.  
  
Although I am near  
  
my voice will come  
  
from a region apart.   
  
It will be as it was, right from the start.  
  
My voice will come  
  
apart, and we will be together  
  
as we were from the start.  
  
I will turn it into  
  
together, apart.  
  
Always be there  
   
turning into  
  
song.
