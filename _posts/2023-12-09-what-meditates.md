Breathe, placid stalwart!  
In lifting all to lightness,  
witness yourself lifted, too.  
You are the buoyant souls  
  
you air with felicity. All else would  
succumb to mass; in translation   
between beings, what cannot  
suffer asymmetry?  
  
You alone â€” rounder than pocket stones,  
years worn by the worried thumbs  
of those who forgot you here,  
breathing.
