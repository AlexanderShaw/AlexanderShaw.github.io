Here is an example poem to demonstrate the site's layout:

## With Pure Heart

Got no father, no mother,  
no god, no homeland,  
no cradle, no shroud,  
no kiss, no lover.  
 
Last three days I haven't eaten  
neither a lot, nor a morsel,  
my twenty years is power,  
I am looking for a buyer.  
 
If no one wants it,  
the devil will take it,  
with a pure heart I will plunder,  
if need be I will murder.  
 
I'll be caught, I'll be gallowed,  
with blessed earth I'll be covered,  
& death spreading grass will grow,  
on my oh, so beautiful heart.   

### József Attila (Translated by Gyukics Gábor and Michael Castro)
