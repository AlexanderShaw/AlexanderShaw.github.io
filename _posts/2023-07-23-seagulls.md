Slow pace, pebbles clatter. Seagulls chatter,  
yellow feet in steely-cold water. Foam  
lathers and washes the pebbles,  
smoothing edges for fingers that gather.  
  
Tide folding over like pancake batter.  
Slow pace, pebbles clatter. Seagulls chatter,  
their pitched words pop bubbled seawater   
lather that washes pebbles, clattering  
  
like chocolate chips rattle,  
folding over in pancake batter.  
Seagulls speak airy-light and lilting chatter,  
pitching words to pop bubbled seawater  
  
and make fine the froth on butter, melting  
with chocolate chips as we prattle  
in the sweet-mouthed morning, bright,  
speaking airy-light and lilting chatter.  
  
Sandaled feet by steely-cold water. Seafoam,  
the lazy froth on melted butter,  
smooths our fingers that gather  
in the sweet-mouthed morning bright.
