the honey tide of summer       
seeps from gashes in the hills       
it spills down    
over itself    
thawing rocks    
leaving them sticky    
sheening    
    
from the hills    
you think you can see    
a meniscus gape    
at a question of its disequilibrium    
puzzled in the heat    
recurved or sagging    

along its shore    
you will start to feel the answer    
the slightest vacuum    
a hum    
your ears may pop    
    
around you    
strewn trash     
no pattern    
no story    
scrambled in diffusion    
flotsam of memories    
habits    
addictions    
once moving    
turning    
now static    
    
step closer    
step in    
acknowledge the coolness of the water    
fill yourself with pressure    
hold it    
    
wade through the membrane    
draw it over you    
feel your density    
slip from gravity    
relax    
forget    
dissolve    
    
but do remember    
fight    
let your legs stab    
rake at the light    
admit your fear    
panic    
open your eyes    
bare them to the dark cold    
wider    
freeze them watching    
wait    
    
the pressure you held    
leaked to without    
it demands reentry    
    
you will gasp     
inverse vomit    
your frigid past    
the ice water you drank    
first thing after a nap     
under hot sand    
    
you will orbit    
towards the drain    
a pupil now dilated    
too immense to care    
gorging    
on something far behind you    
it cannot see you    
    
you will reach the focus    
and when you do    
look up
