Around the bend I sped with glee, my heart  
abound with ardent prayer: that spring may come,  
that I may see the sun and taste the sum  
of nature's feast, as decadent as art.  
The lovers who in moonlit shadow yearned  
as I pedaled, pulse pounding, 'round the curve  
seemed to match my zeal with eager verve ---  
Had not a respite from the frost they earned?   

But as I went along, from corners spoke   
a low voice lisping in briny haste  
of a darker turn that my soul would soak ---  
For the garden begotten of last year's waste,  
may churn and turn into tendrils that choke  
those friendly climes as with a poison laced.
