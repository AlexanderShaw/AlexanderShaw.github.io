She arrives through unseen gates, amid spates  
of a stealthy weed: budding coincidence,  
which soon will bloom to embrace her memory,  
and trace her trajectory in blossoms.  
Look at your threshold! There, she tracked frosty,  
grinning leaves of this yearâ€™s last. There, they yearn,  
pressed by hoary gales, to enter where you pace  
and rouse you from your absent nightwalking.  
  
Eventually, your rite begins; The sky  
she paints a consecrated blue will bleed  
into your stale hall, coating what you let lie  
and effervescing into your atmosphere.   
In blessed air, you may rediscover  
your overwhelming instinct to love her.
