## Loop

&mdash; I remember listening to my mom   
hoot into the woods at night   
and hoots would return back   

that made her hoot more   
which returned more hoots   
and so on.   

This loop rings her endearing   

especially when you learn   
the neighbor was the one hooting back.   

So I cherish it and in doing so   
shared it with a friend   
who put it in a poem.   

And now the loop feels like slack thread.  

I follow it,   
anticipating curvature,   

but catch on knots:   
that poem, its mother   
and always more   

which I'll never untangle.   
I've learned not to try that.   

But I think I can tie it back together,  
if I someday reach the end   
still holding onto the beginning &mdash;
