Pantoum I  

Once again awaiting spring  
with all its sordid troubles.  
I loiter at the water’s edge, watch  
that stone I threw, sinking.
 
And so all my sordid troubles  
come knocking at the door!  
That stone I throw, it always sinks,  
the cake is always dry.
 
You: knocking at my door,  
patiently listening as I proclaim:  
“The cake is always dry.”  
Wordlessly, you agree.  
 
Patiently listening as I complain:  
“Once again, awaiting spring,”  
you disagree wordlessly.  
We loiter at the water’s edge, watching.  


Pantoum II  

All my thoughts are simple now,  
barely like a child's.  
Instead I only hope, and cast  
you from my side.

Barely like a child, you  
stumble towards me  
from every side,  
embrace me completely.

Stumbling toward myself,  
I lose sight of all meaning,  
only embrace myself completely:  
all ungainly shapes recast.

Losing sight of all meaning,  
all my thoughts are simple now,  
all the ungainly shapes recast;  
Instead I only hope.
