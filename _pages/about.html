<h2>What is Bird Calls about?</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bird Calls is the time you got trapped inside a shed with chickens and dusty barrels of their feed and you banged through the glass with a shovel's head, shrieking, until your grandma came and picked you up.
She was alarmed you resorted to such measures so quickly. 
What she didn't know is that you saw your whole life flash before you, you with chubby fists and dust allergies. 
You saw it all reduced to a single dusty point stuck here inside this coop, hens murmuring lullabies and peacocks honking their noisy flirtations. 
When you got out, you did not forget the latch's click. You could not fly but you had other methods of departure.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bird Calls is where a moment goes, like that time you saw a woman on the subway thoughtlessly undo her braid with slim fingers, or how thick afternoon light falls on the birdcage in your mother's living room. It was small; it resisted yielding itself to a friend, when you tried, in vain, to describe its simple charm. But it stayed with you, tucked into a shadowy corner of your mind. Later, ripened by time and metaphor, you found it, its newly emboldened contours, and placed it carefully in a story, or maybe a poem. Once, it had been fleeting.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bird Calls is the future, for it is to mimic the sonorous heart of youth. It is thought refined,
well-cited and without excess. In this information age of pitfalls, where we are impressed with trap questions that swallow
minds, the eternal birds sing the truth. Bird Calls is an attempt to transcribe their song.
